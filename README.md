User applications, especially those deployed with StatefulSets that use PersistentVolumeClaims, can have problems if 
you want their Pods to be resilient to node failure. Kubernetes does not clean up StatefulSet Pods because it makes 
guarantees that there will never be two copies the same StatefulSet Pod running at the same time accessing storage. 
For the complete discussion and rationale, go to https://github.com/kubernetes/community and search for the pod-safety.md file (path: contributors/design-proposals/storage/pod-safety.md)

Also, as a background you should read the following page regarding forced deletion of Pods in a StatefulSet. 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/force-delete-stateful-set-pod/#:~:text=In%20normal%20operation%20of%20a,1%20are%20alive%20and%20ready.

Nevertheless, customers are asking for a solution to this problem, so that Pods created as part of StatefulSets 
that use PersistentVolumes can be "restarted" on a different node within a reasonable time (a few minutes) if 
the node they are executing on fails. In reality as a Pod is never migrated from one node to another, what has 
to happen is the old Pod has to be terminated, and a replacement pod- using the same volumes- has to then be 
scheduled on a functioning node.
