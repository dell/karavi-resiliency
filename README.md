User applications can have problems if you want their Pods to be resilient to node failure. This is especially true of those deployed with StatefulSets that use PersistentVolumeClaims. Kubernetes guarantees that there will never be two copies of the same StatefulSet Pod running at the same time and accessing storage. Therefore, it does not clean up StatefulSet Pods. 
 
For the complete discussion and rationale, please visit [Pod Safety, Consistency Guarantees, and Storage Implications](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/pod-safety.md).

For more background on forced deletion of Pods in a StatefulSet, please visit [Force Delete StatefulSet Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/force-delete-stateful-set-pod/#:~:text=In%20normal%20operation%20of%20a,1%20are%20alive%20and%20ready).

Nevertheless, customers are asking that Pods created as part of StatefulSets using PersistentVolumes can be "restarted" on a different node. 
This would have to be accomplished within a reasonable time (a few minutes) if the node they are executing on fails. Since a Pod is never migrated from one node to another, 
the solution is for the old Pod to be terminated, and a replacement pod using the same volumes, to be scheduled on a functioning node.
