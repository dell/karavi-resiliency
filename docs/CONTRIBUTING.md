## Introduction

## Issues

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Signing your commits

We require that developers sign off their commits to certify that they have permission to contribute the code in a pull request. This way of certifying is commonly known as the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). We encourage all contributors to read the DCO text before signing a commit and making contributions.

To make sure that pull requests have all commits signed off, we use the Probot DCO plugin.

### Signing off a commit

Using the git command line
Use either `--signoff` or `-s` with the commit command. See this [document](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) for an example.

Make sure you have your username and e-mail set. The `--signoff` or `-s` option will use the configured username and e-mail, so it is important to configure it before the first time you commit. Check the following references:

* Setting up your github username [reference](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/)
* Setting up your e-mail address [reference](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/)

In practice, just add a line to every git commit message:

Signed-off-by: Jane Smith jane.smith@example.com Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

## Code Style

## TODOs in the code
We don't like TODOs in the code. It would be excellent if you sort out all issues you can see with the changes before we check the changes in.
